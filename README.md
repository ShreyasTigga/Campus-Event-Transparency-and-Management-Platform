# Campus-Event-Transparency-and-Management-Platform
A Spring Boot–based backend application designed to manage campus users and events with secure authentication. The system implements a layered architecture (Controller–Service–Repository), uses MySQL with JPA/Hibernate for data persistence, and follows DTO-based request/response handling. It includes secure user registration and login using BCrypt password hashing and JWT-based authentication, role-based access control via Spring Security, and RESTful APIs tested using Postman. The project emphasizes clean architecture, security best practices, and scalability.
